		/*
		 * Stack        --- Java 1.0 Legacy Class (Extends Vector)
		 * Collection   --- Added into Collections Framework in Java 1.2
		 *
		 * Size         --- Number of elements currently stored
		 * Capacity     --- Internal array size (Inherited from Vector, Default = 10)
		 *                  Stack<Integer> st = new Stack<>();
		 *
		 *
		 * Default Capacity                  --- 10  (From Vector)
		 * Initial Capacity                  --- 10  (Can be increased explicitly)
		 * Allow Duplicates                  --- Yes
		 * Allow null values                 --- Yes
		 * Maintain the insertion order      --- Yes
		 * Maintain the sorted order         --- No
		 * Offer random access               --- Yes (Because internally uses Vector → array)
		 * Synchronized (One task at a time) --- Yes (Inherited from Vector)
		 * Thread Safe                       --- Yes (But outdated due to overhead)
		 *
		 * Expansion Rule                    --- New capacity = old capacity * 2
		 *                                      (Same as Vector, doubles when full)
		 *
		 * What is it good at?               --- LIFO operations (push, pop, peek),
		 *                                      Reversing data,
		 *                                      Expression evaluation (prefix/postfix),
		 *                                      Backtracking algorithms (DFS, undo operations).
		 *
		 * Limitation                        --- Legacy class,
		 *                                      Slower due to synchronization,
		 *                                      Recommended alternative → Deque (ArrayDeque, LinkedList)
